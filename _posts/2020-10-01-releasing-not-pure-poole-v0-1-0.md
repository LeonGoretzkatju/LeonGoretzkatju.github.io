## Brief
Hello! Welcome to My personal website, my name is Liu Xiangchen, a senior student who is interested in Indoor SLAM Robotics and Geometric/Semantic Segmentation. I am also the vice captain of Robotics Team in Tianjin University, participating in the [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) on behalf of our school, I am responsible for the auto-aim system using the machine vision.
## Research
I am interested in SLAM, especially the Indoor SLAM, In 2021, I participated the development of the iTAM: an incremental tracking and mapping system using RGB-D camera as an research intern in Computer
Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality, Technical University of Munich. I am responsible for the scene completion using multi-level geometric constraints, 3D reconstrcution using the TSDF and the PlanarMesh.In my future research, I am eager to solve the pose estimation, accurate and intelligent map reconsturcion in the indoor environmenrt with low texture, where the traditional feature extraction algorithm based on Point will fail.Combining the traditional feature-based segmentation and the deep learning method to get the better performance on the scene completion and image inpainting.
## Competitions
As a member of the control and the vision group of Tianjin University Competition Robotics Team, I am mainly responsible for coding and designing the control algorithm and auto-aim algorithm for the robots in the Robomaster 2020/2021. We ranked 42/200+ in the competition.
In 2021, I became the Technical Director of Tianjin University Competition Robotics Team, mainly responsible for developing high performance robot detection and tracking algorithm and designing accurate robot positioning and navigation algorithms. We both won Second Prize in the competitions of Robomaster 2021.
