## Introduction

The [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) University Championship focuses on the comprehensive application and engineering practice abilities of the participants in science and engineering disciplines, fully integrating many robot-related technical disciplines such as “machine vision”, “embedded system design”, “mechanical control”, “inertial navigation”, “human-computer interaction”. At the same time, the innovative combination of e-sports presentation and robotic competition makes the robot confrontation more intuitive and intense, attracting the attention of many technology enthusiasts and the public.

## About Me

As a member of the control group in Tianjin University Robotics Team, I am responsible for coding and designing the control algorithm for the super-capacity, which is used in our robot in order to get the better performance in the Competition. I used multi sensors to get the state information such as current and voltage from the capacity, then I designed the PID controller to efficiently charge and discharge from the capacity. The source code is available at  [github](https://github.com/LeonGoretzkatju/SuperCapacity_embedded_code). Finally we got the Third Prize in China University Robot Competition 2020.

In [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) 2021, I became the Technical Director of the Vision-Algorithm group in Tianjin University Robotics Team, mainly responsible for developing the auto-aim system of the robot using the monocular and stereo vision, I combined the traditional computer vision method based on the geometric feature extraction and the neutral network method, our detection for some specific objects achieves real-time (200fps+) and it is robust enough to work on most normal situations. To achieve better performance in shooting moving targets, I fused the IMU data to do the motion prediction. This makes the system outperforms the human players in hit rate. This system is applied for the RoboMaster competition as an aim-support system and shows good results. The vision system was applied in the Robomaster 2021, we got the Second Prize in the China University Robot Competition.

The test video is as follows, as you can see, the shooting device can accurately track the enemy robot even the robot rotate and high speed.

In [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) 2022, I became the vice captain of the Tianjin University Robotics Team, mainly responsible for developing the stereo-vision system used industrial camera devices to reach a stage where the auto-aim system can perform more robustly and accurately, by redesigning the object-detection algorithm and predicting algorithm, the auto-aim system based on the stereo-vision perform much more better than the monocular-vision system in hit rate and success rate of the object detection.
